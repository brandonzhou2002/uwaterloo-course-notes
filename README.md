# uwaterloo-course-notes
This repository contains my course notes for courses I have taken at the University of Waterloo. The notes are written in LaTex or Markdown.
You can find my course notes for some *specific* courses here. The notes will be systematically updated at 23:59 on respective course days throughout the study term. I hope you find them useful!

**Automated Updates for Uninterrupted Access**

In a bid to ensure continuity and timely access to fresh insights, I have implemented an automatic update mechanism during my study term. Notes will be systematically updated around 23:59 on each day a course is scheduled.

To elucidate:

- For courses scheduled on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the repository will be refreshed with new notes on those respective days, promptly at 23:59.
- Similarly, if a course is slated for Tuesday and Thursday, updates will be facilitated at 23:59 on both days.

Your understanding is appreciated if content updates experience any delays. I strive to provide the most current content and welcome your feedback and insights!
